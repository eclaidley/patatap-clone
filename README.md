# Patatap Clone

A clone of [Patatap]("https://patatap.com/"), built with the [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) libraries. 

It is based on an exercise in Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy.

## How It Works

* Each letter key from A - Z is assigned to a corresponding sound event and color animation.
* Press any letter key(s) to trigger these events.
